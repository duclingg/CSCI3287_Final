## Description of Project  
### THE APARTMENT COMPLEX DATABASE  
A company owns a large apartment complex and needs a database to do the business of renting
apartments, charging for amenities such as laundry machine tokens, garages ,and storage areas,
loaning out equipment such as rug machines and simple tools like screw drivers, hammers and
hoses, and scheduling and completing maintenance jobs. This database allows for the
management of tenants, their apartments, property maintenance, and the various amenities and
services provided by the apartment complex. One output of the database is a list ordered by apartment 
number of all the tenants and their contact information. The database will allow the owners to track 
tenant payments and show a list of whose rent is late along with the term of the lease and how to contact 
the tenant to find out whatâ€™s up. They will also have a list of leases expiring in the next 3 months so 
that they can offer the tenant an extension or determine if they are moving out and know on what day the
apartment will be vacant. The list should show if the tenant is also going to release a garage or a
storage area that they pay extra for. When they loan out amenities like tools and rug machines,
they charge a daily fee and a small deposit which is returned when the loaned item is returned in
good shape. They also sell laundry supplies and tokens for the laundry machines in the complex
and a few other things like curtain rods, shower curtain liners and postage stamps. At the end of
each month, they want to know how much they made from their extra services and supplies.
They like to see 12 months back and total things by sales and loans. The database facilitates
maintenance requests and complePons. There is an ongoing list of projects grouped by
maintenance types (for example, carpentry, plumbing, mechanical and appliance repair, and pest
control). Within each group we can see the date requested, date scheduled, date completed for
each project. Quarterly, there is a report that shows job categories, the number of projects
completed, the percentage of all projects requested in the quarter that are completed and the
average Pme of complePon in hours for a project in that category.
The database holds data about for 48 apartments (we know the number of bedrooms, the
monthly rent and the apartment number of each apartment). 42 apartments are rented by 60
tenants. We always have to know who lives in an apartment, so we record ALL tenant names.
We also have 10% of the apartments with leases expiring on various last-day-of-the-month dates
in the next 100 days, while the rest have expiraPons on last-day-of-the-month dates in the next 2
years. In an average month there are 15 new maintenance requests. 50 percent of tenants take
advantage of at least 3 ameniPes purchases per month. Tools and equipment are loaned out
about once a week. We know who has them and when they were checked out and when they
are returned. There are 32 garages and all of them are rented. There are 24 storage spaces and
18 of them are rented. We must record the start and end dates of the leases for the storage and
garages as well.
